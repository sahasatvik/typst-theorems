= Introduction

The `typst-theorems` package provides `Typst` functions that help create
numbered `theorem` environments. This is heavily inspired by the #LATEX
packages `amsthm` and `thmtools`.

A _theorem environment_ lets you wrap content together with automatically
updating _numbering_ information. Such environments use internal `state`
counters for this purpose. Environments can

- share the same counter (_Theorems_ and _Lemmas_ often do so)
- keep a global count, or be attached to
  - other environments (_Corollaries_ are often numbered based upon the parent _Theorem_)
  - headings
- have a numbering level depth fixed (for instance, use only top level heading
  numbers)
- be referenced elsewhere in the document, via `label`s


= Using `typst-theorems`

Import all functions provided by `typst-theorems` using
```typst
#import "theorems.typ": *
#show: thm-rules
```
The second line is crucial for displaying `thm-env`s and references correctly!

The core of this module consists of `thm-env`.
The functions `thm-plain`, `thm-def`, `thm-rem`, and `thm-proof` functions
provide some simple defaults for the appearance of `thm-env`s.


= Feature demonstration

Create box-like _theorem environments_ using `thm-plain`, a wrapper around
`thm-env` which provides some simple defaults.

```typst
#let theorem = thm-plain("Theorem")
```
#let theorem = thm-plain(
  "Theorem",
)

Such definitions are convenient to place in the preamble or a template; use
the environment in your document via
#table[
```typst
#theorem("Euclid")[
  There are infinitely many primes.
] <euclid>
```
][
  #theorem("Euclid")[
    There are infinitely many primes.
  ] <euclid>
]
Note that the `name` is optional. This `theorem` environment will be numbered
based on its parent `heading` counter, with successive `theorem`s
automatically updating the final index.

The `<euclid>` label can be used to refer to this Theorem via the reference
`@euclid`. Go to @references to read more.

You can create another environment which uses the same counter, say for
_Lemmas_, as follows.

```typst
#let lemma = thm-plain(
  "Lemma",                // head
  counter: "Theorem",     // same as that of Theorem
                          // options for styling the block
  fill: rgb("#e8e8f8"),
  outset: 0.7em,
  padding: (y: 0.5em)
)
```
#let lemma = thm-plain(
  "Lemma",
  counter: "Theorem",
  fill: rgb("#e8e8f8"),
  outset: 0.7em,
  padding: (y: 0.5em)
)

Note that the counter for `theorem` defaulted to 'Theorem'.

#table[
```typst
#lemma[
  If $n$ divides both $x$ and $y$, it
  also divides $x - y$.
]
```
][
#lemma[
  If $n$ divides both $x$ and $y$, it also divides $x - y$.
]
]

You can _attach_ other environments to ones defined earlier. For instance,
_Corollaries_ can be created as follows.

```typst
#let corollary = thm-plain(
  "Corollary",            // head
  base: "Theorem",        // base - use the theorem counter
)
```
#let corollary = thm-plain(
  "Corollary",
  base: "Theorem",
)


#table[
```typst
#corollary(numbering: "1.1")[
  If $n$ divides two consecutive natural
  numbers, then $n = 1$.
]
```
][
#corollary(numbering: "1.1")[
  If $n$ divides two consecutive natural numbers, then $n = 1$.
]
]

Note that we have provided a `numbering` string; this can be any valid
numbering pattern as described in the
#link("https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/numbering/")[numbering]
documentation.


== Proofs

The `thm-proof` function gives nicer defaults for formatting proofs.
```typst
#let proof = thm-proof("Proof")
```
#let proof = thm-proof("Proof")

#table[
```typst
#proof([of @euclid])[
  Suppose to the contrary that $p_1,
  p_2, dots, p_n$ is a finite
  enumeration of all primes. Set $P
  = p_1 p_2 dots p_n$. Since $P + 1$
  is not in our list, it cannot be
  prime. Thus, some prime factor
  $p_j$ divides $P + 1$. Since $p_j$
  also divides $P$, it must divide
  the difference $(P + 1) - P = 1$, a
  contradiction.
]
```
][
#proof([of @euclid])[
  Suppose to the contrary that $p_1, p_2, dots, p_n$ is a finite enumeration
  of all primes. Set $P = p_1 p_2 dots p_n$. Since $P + 1$ is not in our list,
  it cannot be prime. Thus, some prime factor $p_j$ divides $P + 1$.  Since
  $p_j$ also divides $P$, it must divide the difference $(P + 1) - P = 1$, a
  contradiction.
]
]
If your proof ends in a block equation, or a list/enum, you can place
`qedhere` to correctly position the qed symbol.

#table[
```typst
#theorem[
  There are arbitrarily long stretches
  of composite numbers.
]
#proof[
  For any $n > 2$, consider $
    n! + 2, quad n! + 3, quad ...,
    quad n! + n #qedhere
  $
]
```
][
#theorem[
  There are arbitrarily long stretches of composite numbers.
]
#v(1em)
#proof[
  For any $n > 2$, consider $
    n! + 2, quad n! + 3, quad ..., quad n! + n #qedhere
  $
]
]

*Caution*: The `qedhere` symbol does not play well with numbered/multiline
equations!

You can set a custom qed symbol (say $square$) by setting the appropriate
option in `thm-rules` as follows.
```typst
#show: thm-rules.with(qed-symbol: $square$)
```

== Suppressing numbering
Supplying `numbering: none` suppresses numbering for that environment, and
prevents it from updating its counter.

```typst
#let conjecture = thm-plain(
  "Conjecture",
  numbering: none
)
```
#let conjecture = thm-plain(
  "Conjecture",
  numbering: none
)

#table[
```typst
#conjecture[
  The numbers $2$, $3$, and $17$ are
  prime.
]
```
][
#conjecture[
  The numbers $2$, $3$, and $17$ are prime.
]
]

You can also suppress numbering individually, as follows.
#table[
```typst
#lemma(numbering: none)[
  The square of any even number is
  divisible by $4$.
]
#lemma[
  The square of any odd number is one
  more than a multiple of $4$.
]
```
][
#lemma(numbering: none)[
  The square of any even number is divisible by $4$.
]
#v(1em)
#lemma[
  The square of any odd number is one more than a multiple of $4$.
]
]

Note that the last _Lemma_ is _not_ numbered 3.2.2!

You can also override the automatic numbering as follows.
#table[
```typst
#lemma(number: "42")[
  The square of any natural number cannot be two more than a multiple of 4.
]
```
][
#lemma(number: "42")[
  The square of any natural number cannot be two more than a multiple of 4.
]
]

Note that this does _not_ affect the counters either!


== Limiting depth

You can limit the number of levels of the `base` numbering used as follows.
```typst
#let definition = thm-def(
  "Definition",
  base-level: 1           // take only the first level from the base
)
```
#let definition = thm-def(
  "Definition",
  base-level: 1
)

#table[
```typst
#definition("Prime numbers")[
  A natural number is called a _prime
  number_ if it is greater than $1$ and
  cannot be written as the product of
  two smaller natural numbers.
] <prime>
```
][
#definition("Prime numbers")[
  A natural number is called a _prime number_ if it is greater than $1$ and
  cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
] <prime>
]

Note that this environment is _not_ numbered 3.3.1! Here we have used the
`thm-def` function which is typically used for styling definitions.

#table[
```typst
#definition("Composite numbers")[
  A natural number is called a
  _composite number_ if it is greater
  than $1$ and not prime.
]
```
][
#definition("Composite numbers")[
  A natural number is called a _composite number_ if it is greater than $1$
  and not prime.
]
]

Setting a `base-level` higher than what `base` provides will introduce padded
zeroes.

```typst
#let example = thm-rem(
  "Example",
  numbering: "1.1"
)
```
#let example = thm-rem(
  "Example",
  numbering: "1.1"
)


#table[
```typst
#example(base-level: 4)[
  The numbers $4$, $6$, and $42$
  are composite.
]
```
][
#example(base-level: 4)[
  The numbers $4$, $6$, and $42$ are composite.
]
]

Here, we have used the `thm-rem` function which suppresses numbering by
default.


== Custom formatting
The `thm-box` function (and its derivatives: `thm-plain`, `thm-def`,
`thm-rem`, `thm-proof`) lets you specify rules for formatting the `title`, the
`name`, and the `body` individually. Here, the `title` refers to the `head`
and `number` together.

```typst
#let proof-custom = thm-box(
  "Proof",
  title-fmt: smallcaps,
  body-fmt: body => [
    #body #h(1fr) $square$    // float a QED symbol to the right
  ],
  numbering: none
)
```
#let proof-custom = thm-box(
  "Proof",
  title-fmt: smallcaps,
  body-fmt: body => [
    #body #h(1fr) $square$
  ],
  numbering: none
)

#table[
```typst
#lemma[
  All even natural numbers greater than
  2 are composite.
]
#proof-custom[
  Every even natural number $n$ can be
  written as the product of the natural
  numbers $2$ and $n\/2$. When $n > 2$,
  both of these are smaller than $2$
  itself.
]
```
][
#lemma[
  All even natural numbers greater than 2 are composite.
]
#proof-custom[
  Every even natural number $n$ can be written as the product of the natural
  numbers $2$ and $n\/2$. When $n > 2$, both of these are smaller than $2$
  itself.
]
]

You can go even further and use the `thm-env` function directly. It accepts an
`counter`, a `base`, a `base-level`, and a `fmt` function.
```typst
#let notation = thm-env(
  "notation",                 // counter
  (name, number, body, color: black) => [
                              // fmt - format content using the environment
                              // name, number, body, and an optional color
    #text(color)[#h(1.2em) *Notation (#number) #name*]:
    #h(0.2em)
    #body
    #v(0.5em)
  ]
).with(numbering: "I")        // use Roman numerals
```
#let notation = thm-env(
  "notation",                 // counter
  // none,                       // base - do not attach, count globally
  // none,                       // base-level - use the base as-is
  (name, number, body, color: black) => [
                              // fmt - format content using the environment name, number, body, and an optional color
    #text(color)[*Notation (#number) #name*]:
    #h(0.2em)
    #body
    #v(0.5em)
  ]
).with(numbering: "I")        // use Roman numerals

#table[
```typst
#notation[
  The variable $p$ is reserved for
  prime numbers.
]
#notation("for Reals", color: green)[
  The variable $x$ is reserved for
  real numbers.
]
```
][
#notation[
  The variable $p$ is reserved for prime numbers.
]
#notation("for Reals", color: green)[
  The variable $x$ is reserved for real numbers.
]
]

Note that the `color: green` named argument supplied to the `notation`
environment gets passed to the `fmt` function. In general, all extra named
arguments supplied to the theorem will be passed to `fmt`.
On the other hand, the positional argument `"for Reals"` will always be
interpreted as the `name` argument in `fmt`.

#table[
```typst
#lemma(title: "Lem.", stroke: 1pt)[
  All multiples of 3 greater than 3
  are composite.
]
```
][
#lemma(title: "Lem.", stroke: 1pt, outset: 0.7em)[
  All multiples of 3 greater than 3 are composite.
]
]

Here, we override the `title` (which defaults to the `head`) as well as the
`stroke` in the `fmt` produced by `thm-plain`. All `block` arguments can be
overridden in `thm-plain` environments in this way.


== Labels and references <references>

You can place a `<label>` outside a theorem environment, and reference it
later via `@label`. For example, go back to @euclid.

#table[
```typst
Recall that there are infinitely many prime numbers via @euclid.
```
][
Recall that there are infinitely many prime numbers via @euclid.
][
```typst
You can reference future environments too, like @oddprime[Lem.].
```
][
You can reference future environments too, like @oddprime[Lem.].
][
```typst
#lemma(supplement: "Lem.")[
  All primes apart from $2$ and $3$ are
  of the form $6k plus.minus 1$.
] <primeform>

You can modify the supplement to be used in references, like @primeform.
```
][
#lemma(supplement: "Lem.")[
  All primes apart from $2$ and $3$ are of the form $6k plus.minus 1$.
] <primeform>

#v(1.2em)
You can modify the supplement to be used in references, like @primeform.
]

*Caution*: Links created by references to `thm-env`s will be styled according
to `#show link:` rules. To avoid this, use the following workaround:

```typst
#show link: it => {
  // Keep default styling for label links.
  if type(it.dest) == label {
    return it
  }
  // Your custom link styling goes here.
}
```


== Overriding `base`

```typst
#let remark = thm-rem(
  "Remark",
  base: "heading",
  numbering: "1.1"
)
```
#let remark = thm-rem(
  "Remark",
  base: "heading",
  numbering: "1.1"
)

#table[
```typst
#remark[
  There are infinitely many composite
  numbers.
]
```
][
#remark[
  There are infinitely many composite numbers.
]
][
```typst
#lemma[
  All primes greater than $2$ are odd.
] <oddprime>

#remark(base: "Theorem")[
  Two is a _lone prime_.
]
```
][
#lemma[
  All primes greater than $2$ are odd.
] <oddprime>
#remark(base: "Theorem")[
  Two is a _lone prime_.
]
]

This `remark` environment, which would normally be attached to the current
_heading_, now uses the Theorem (which shares its counter with the Lemma)
as a base.


#v(2em)

= Function reference -- Deprecated!

== `thm-rules`

The `thm-rules` show rule sets important styling rules for theorem
environments, references, and equations in proofs.

```typst
#let thm-rules(
  qed-symbol: $qed$,          // QED symbol used in proofs
  doc
) = { ... }
```

== `thm-env`

The `thm-env` function produces a _theorem environment_.
```typst
#let thm-env(
  counter,                    // environment counter name
  fmt                         // formatting function of the form
                              // (name, number, body, ..args) -> content
  base: none,                 // base counter name, can be "heading" or none
  base-level: none,           // number of base number levels to use
) = { ... }
```

The `fmt` function must accept a theorem `name`, `number`, `body`, and produce
formatted content. It may also accept additional positional arguments, via
`args`.

A _theorem environment_ is itself a map of the following form.
```typst
(
  ..args,
  body,                       // body content
  number: auto,               // number, overrides numbering if present
  numbering: "1.1",           // numbering style, can be a function
  supplement: counter,        // supplement used in references
  base: base,                 // base counter name override
  base-level: base-level      // base-level override
) -> content
```

The only positional argument accepted in `args` is the `name`, which is the
optional name of the theorem typically displayed after the title.
All additional named arguments in `args` will be passed on to the associated
`fmt` function supplied in `thm-env`.


== `thm-box`

The `thm-box` wraps `thm-env`, supplying a box-like `fmt` function.
```typst
#let thm-box(
  head,                       // head - common name, used in the title
  counter: auto,              // counter, defaults to "head"
  ..args,                     // named arguments, passed to #block
  padding: (y: 0.1em),        // padding around the block, passed to #pad
  numbering: "1.1",           // numbering style, can be a function
  supplement: auto,           // supplement for references, defaults to "head"
  name-fmt: x => [(#x)],      // formatting for name
  title-fmt: x => x,          // formatting for title (head + number)
  body-fmt: x => x,           // formatting for body
  separator: [.#h(0.2em)],    // separator inserted between name and body
  base: "heading",            // base - defaults to using headings
  base-level: none,           // base-level - defaults to using base as-is
) = { ... }
```

The `thm-box` function sets a default `width: 100%` for the `block`.


== `thm-plain`, `thm-def`, and `thm-rem`

These functions are identical to `thm-box`, with default styling options
mimicking the `plain`, `definition`, and `remark` styles from `amsthm`.

The 'plain' style has a bold title and italicized body. This is typically used
for Theorems, Lemmas, Corollaries, Propositions, etc.
```typst
#let thm-plain = thm-box.with(
  title-fmt: strong,
  body-fmt: emph,
  separator: [*.*#h(0.2em)],
)
```

The 'definition' style has a bold title and upright body. This is typically
used for Definitions, Problems, Exercises, etc.
```typst
#let thm-def = thm-box.with(
  title-fmt: strong,
  separator: [*.*#h(0.2em)],
)
```

The 'remark' style has an italicized title and upright body, with numbering
suppressed by default. This is typically used for Remarks, Notes, Notation,
etc.
```typst
#let thm-rem = thm-box.with(
  padding: (y: 0em),
  name-fmt: name => emph([(#name)]),
  title-fmt: emph,
  separator: [.#h(0.2em)],
  numbering: none
)
```

== `thm-proof`, `proof-body-fmt` and `qedhere`

The `thm-proof` function is identical to `thm-rem`, except with defaults
appropriate for proofs.

```typst
#let thm-proof = thm-rem.with(
    name-fmt: emph,
    body-fmt: proof-body-fmt,
)
```

The `proof-body-fmt` function is a `body-fmt` function that automatically places
a qed symbol at the end of the body.

You can use `#qedhere` inside a block equation, or at the end of a list/enum
item to place the qed symbol on the same line.
