#definition("Prime numbers")[
  A natural number is called a #highlight[_prime number_] if it is greater
  than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
]
#remark[
  The numbers $2$, $3$, and $17$ are prime.
  @cor_largest_prime shows that this list is not exhaustive!
]

#theorem("Euclid")[
  There are infinitely many primes.
]
#proof[
  Suppose to the contrary that $p_1, p_2, dots, p_n$ is a finite enumeration
  of all primes. Set $P = p_1 p_2 dots p_n$. Since $P + 1$ is not in our list,
  it cannot be prime. Thus, some prime factor $p_j$ divides $P + 1$.  Since
  $p_j$ also divides $P$, it must divide the difference $(P + 1) - P = 1$, a
  contradiction.

#corollary[
  There is no largest prime number.
] <cor_largest_prime>
#corollary[
  There are infinitely many composite numbers.
]

#theorem[
  There are arbitrarily long stretches of composite numbers.
]
#proof[
  For any $n > 2$, consider $
    n! + 2, quad n! + 3, quad ..., quad n! + n. #qedhere
